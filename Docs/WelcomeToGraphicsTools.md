# Welcome to Graphics Tools

![Mixed Reality Toolkit](Images/Logos/MRTK_Unreal_GT_Banner_Rounded.png)

Graphics Tools is the second MRTK-Unreal component to be released and is currently only supported on HoloLens 2. The component plugin includes code, blueprints and example assets created to help improve the visual fidelity of Mixed Reality applications while staying within performance budgets.

## Development 

If you're new to MRTK or Mixed Reality development in Unreal, we recommend starting at the beginning of our [Unreal development journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/unreal-development-overview), which was specifically created to walk you through installation, core concepts, and usage. 

> [!CAUTION]
> The Unreal development journey currently uses **Graphics Tools 0.1.x** and **Unreal 4.26.0 or later**. If you're working with other configurations it's still recommended that you start there, but you can also refer to the **[installation instructions](Installation.md)**.

## Documentation versioning

We have complete documentation for all release versions, but we recommend using the highest numbered public release branch for stability. Versions can be selected from the dropdown at the top-right of the screen:
