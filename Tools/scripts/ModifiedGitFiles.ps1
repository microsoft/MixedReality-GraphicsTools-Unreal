.SYNOPSIS
    This script generates a list of changed files between two git branches (in particular files
    modified in a given pull request) and outputs that list to a file.
.DESCRIPTION
    Generates a file containing a list of all modified files (added/modified) in
    the given pull request. The output file contains a list of paths relative to repo root,
    each file on separate line. E.g.:

    UXToolsGame/UXToolsGame.uproject
    UXToolsGame/Config/HoloLens/HoloLensEngine.ini

    The file will not contain files that have been completely deleted (for example, if
    a change deleted UXToolsGame/Content/DeletedFile.uasset), that line will not exist
    in the output file.

    The script will fetch the target branch from origin if it doesn't exist in the local git repo.
    This is what happens by default on Azure DevOps pipeline integration with pull requests (shallow fetch).
    In particular, this will checkout via this command:
    git fetch --force --tags --prune --progress --no-recurse-submodules origin $(System.PullRequest.TargetBranch)
.EXAMPLE
    .\ModifiedGitFiles.ps1 -OutputFile c:\path\to\changes\file.txt -PullRequestId 1234 -RepoRoot c:\path\to\mrtk -TargetBranch mrtk_development
